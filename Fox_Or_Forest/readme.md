# ðŸ¦Š Fox or Forest? â€“ A Deep Learning Image Classification Challenge

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

In 2015, an intriguing challenge was posed: **Can a machine distinguish between a bird and a forest in an image?** This binary classification problem introduced many to the potential of computer vision in environmental contexts.

Building on this idea, Iâ€™ve set out to answer a modern, equally nuanced question:  
> **Can a model accurately differentiate between a fox and a forest?**

At first glance, foxes and forests can visually blendâ€”similar tones, textures, and backgrounds make it a compelling classification task. This project leverages cutting-edge deep learning to tackle this challenge.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Inspiration

This project was inspired by the first video lecture of the FastAI course, led by **Jeremy Howard**, a leader in the field of deep learning. In this session, he discusses the power of **transfer learning**â€”retraining pre-trained models to solve niche, high-impact problems with smaller datasets.

Witnessing how pre-trained architectures like **ResNet** can be fine-tuned to deliver high performance on custom datasets motivated me to explore this concept through a real-world lens.

## ðŸš€ Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Curated datasets of foxes and forest images.
2. **Preprocessing**: Applied transformations (resize, normalization) for model readiness.
3. **Model Selection**: Chose a pre-trained **ResNet** architecture for its balance of speed and accuracy.
4. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuned the ResNet model on the fox vs. forest dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Achieved high accuracy with minimal overfitting; evaluated through validation loss, accuracy, and confusion matrices.
6. **Visualization**: Showcased prediction results and model confidence scores.
